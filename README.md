# Todo/Task list with PHP, JQuery & AJAX implementing basic CRUD operations

Updated version of <a href="http://vankolivehosting-com.stackstaging.com/todo/">this disaster</a> with AJAX and nicer alerts, and now fully covering every aspect of CRUD.

Still a few things to be added (descending sorting for one), and a few minor changes/fixes to be made here and there - mainly an annoying bug with descending sort, hence the disabled property.

<b>NOTE :</b> JQuery only flushes the database after someone explicitly <b>closes</b> the page, doesn't work on redirects yet. So I will kindly ask you to close the tab as normal. Will fix this shortly.


As always - any feedback is appreciated : )
